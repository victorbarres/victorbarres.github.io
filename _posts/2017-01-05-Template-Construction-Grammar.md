## Summary

Template Construction Grammar (TCG) is developed as part of an overarching effort to build a system-level 
neuro-computational model simulating the dynamics at play during language-vision interactions.

TCG offers a computational framework designed to model the human brain\'s capacity to dynamically 
coordinate two concurrent incremental processes, one generating a message and the other organizing its mapping onto a linguistic form.

It also serves to showcase how Schema Theory, and its key tenets of distributed and dynamic cooperative computation, provides guidelines to implement 
cognitive-level hybrid computational models that operate in the style of the brain.


TCG emerges from an attempt to build a language model that integrates rather than dissects. 

The project\'s straddles three main fields: neurolinguistics (in particular aphasiology), psycholinguistics, and cognitive linguistics (in particular usage-based construction grammar theories).
