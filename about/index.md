## Personal interests
* Historical linguistics, the evolution of language (biological and cultural), and any crossover those might have (or could have) with NLP.
* Any attempt to use NLP in the pursuit of artistic, absurdist, dadaist, pataphysic, oulipian or any other useless or purely playfull goals.
* Philosophy of mind, semiotics, phenomenology, and hermeneutics.
* Mental illness and neuropsychology.
* Cryptography and decipherment.
* Discrete mathematics.
* Self-organization and emergence in complex systems: relations between part and whole.
* Epistemology (a la Francaise).


## True passions
