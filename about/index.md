## Research topics
* Computational neuroscience and brain theory.
* Computational linguistics and artificial intelligence.
* Cognitive neuroscience of language (focus on aphasia, semantics, and neural architecture) and psycholinguistics (focus on Visual World Paradigm)
* Cognitive linguistics (focus on computational construction grammar).
* Situated language use (focus on modeling vision-language interactions).
* Hybrid systems for top-down approach to modeling brain functions.
* Synthetic Brain Imaging (SBI): Predicting EEG signals from neurolinguistics computational models.

## Some personal interests
* Historical linguistics, evolution of language (biological and cultural), and any crossover those might have (or could have) with NLP.
* Cryptography.
* Attempts to use NLP in the pursuit of artistic, absurdist, dadaist, pataphysic, oulipian or any other useless playfull goals.
* Discrete mathematics.
* Coffee (black, no sugar).
* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku"> Tsundoku </a> and labyrinthine libraries.
